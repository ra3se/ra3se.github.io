## Pick your engine!

The original game engine can present issues on modern operating systems,
luckily for us id Software open sourced the engine on August 19, 2005 as they have with many of their prior engines.
Since then the community have and are still updating the engine and make sure that it works for our modern computers.

Keep in mind that you will still need `pak0.pk3` from the original game.

Choose one of the following:

- [quake3e](https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e/releases) _(recommended)_
- [ioquake3](https://ioquake3.org/get-it/)
- Original **Quake III Arena** client
  - [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/quake_iii_gold) _(DRM Free)_
  - [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/Quake_III_Arena/)

Download the mod:

- [Rocket Arena 3 v1.76](http://ra3.lorio.se/game/ra3176.zip)

### Optional

The game will work just fine without this.

- [High-Resolution Texture Replacement Pack](http://ra3.lorio.se/game/xcsv_hires.zip)
- [The Unofficial Patch v1.7](https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-unofficial-patch/downloads/tup-v17)
- [ShinyQuakeThree](https://github.com/BreakingPoint/ShinyQuakeThree)

#### Configure

While It's possible to join the fight with the bare bone configuration, most of use will want that highly polished `autoexec.cfg` checkout our [config](/config/) section.

#### Create a startup shortcut

```
%PATH_TO%/quake3.exe +set fs_game arena +connect ra3.se
```
